# TypeScript Tutorial

This repo is a collection of TypeScript tutorials.

The idea is if you want to learn TypeScript, you can go through the existing material or create a new folder, and play around with the TypeScript lessons that you want to learn, and hopefully you can create an exercise out of your findings.

At the time of writing, there is a `Lessons` folder with sub folders, the subfolders are created with the Category of the lessons you would like to study, or create. For example there is currently a `React` Folder with multiple exercises and solutions for TypeScript specific to `React` that you can try out.

This project is built in Next JS which might be over kill, but the idea is if you want to build out components, and have that visual aspect, you can easily spin up a dev server and make the thing. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repo, and run `yarn` to install the dependencies.

Then you can run `yarn dev` to start the dev server.


**_Note:_** You do not need to run `yarn dev` to see the
TypeScript code, you can just open up the files in your editor of choice.

## Self Learning

If you are teaching yourself a new concept that does not exist in the current repo, create your test file inside of the Playground folder, this folder is for you to play around with TypeScript and learn new concepts.


## Creating a Lesson

To create a lesson, you can create a new folder in the `Lessons` folder, 
Then create your lesson(s) in this folder, you should provide clear instructions on how to complete the lesson, and provide any resources that the user would need to use / read in order to complete the lesson.

You should also create a Solution file for each lesson, which is the final best solution for your lesson. 

The structure might look like this:
